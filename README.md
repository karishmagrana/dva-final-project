DESCRIPTION: For this project we created a website with embedded dashboards for publication companies to use to analyze the media they're publishing. Specifically based on location data and with real time updates.

INSTALLATION & EXECUTION: In order to use our code, users just need to navigate to this site: https://karishmagrana.github.io/dva-final-project/. As an example, we have used the New York Times API as our data source and developed dashboards for them. In order for other publications to use these dashboards, they just have to update the CSV file we have provided with their data in the same format. The data we are using can be seen here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pnNhhX0lNpxxkP6dtYfGSyxawR62ygQg0MFi0U4BPm4/edit?usp=sharing. This will automatically update the dashboard with their real time data.
